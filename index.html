                    <p>Fallout: New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic role-playing video game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda Softworks.</p>
                    <p>
                        The best Fallout game in the series in my opinion, captivating plot with lots of choices and details, fun combat, decent humour and wonky physics.

                    <p>Like a Dragon,known outside of Japan as Yakuza, is a video game franchise created, owned and published by Sega. It incorporates elements of the action-adventure, beat 'em up, and role-playing genres.</p>
                    <p>
                        The series' plotline is essentially a big crime drama. It follows Kiryu Kazuma and his exploits/shenanigans in the underground world of the Yakuza. The main storyline of each game is very captivating, especially Yakuza 0, but its charm lies in its bizarre and humorous substories. The gameplay and combat are generally quite satisfying.

                        Do you want a game to play with your friends? Do you want to explore eerie abandoned facilities with them? Do you want to see them get destroyed in the most horrific and hilarious way imaginable?
                    </p>
                    <p>Then this is THE game for you.</p>
                    <p>
                        One of the best co-op game I've played. The gameplay is simple yet always fun. You are tasked with entering abandoned facilities to collect scraps to then be sold for money. You and the gang can get into all sorts of situations, whether it be actual horror or dumb tomfoolery. No two runs are the same.

                    <p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a first-person shooter survival horror video game franchise developed by Ukrainian game developer GSC Game World. The series is set in an alternate version of the present-day Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in Ukraine.</p>
                    <p>
                        The original trilogy is one of my favories oldie games. Depise its old age, the gameplay still holds up great, only barring some technological issues then and there. But that's what you'll expect from games as old as this.
                    </p>
                    <p>The series' atmosphere is incredible, sets in a devastated version of the Chernobyl Zone, with supernatual anomalies appearing in and out, dangerous mutants and tensions between various factions. You aren't a "hero", no special skill, no reputation, you're nobody in the Zone, your live at risks at every steps you take. Yet your actions WILL have consequences.</p>
                    <p>PS. S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 is out now! Check it out</p>

                    <p>
                        A game that can be enjoyed thoroughly in both singleplayer and multiplayer. In The Forest you are dropped in a forested area in the middle of nowhere - literally. Your plane crashed and your son kidnapped right in front of your eyes by an unknown individual. </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The true horror starts when you enter the island's vast underground cave system, where the most horrifying creatures reside, and uncover the truth about this island's mystery and horror, and the whereabouts of your son.

                    <p>
                        A souls-like game with utterly beautiful visual, gorgeous environment, unique and stylistic enemies and weapons design and moving soundtracks. A playable museum artwork.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The gameplay is satifying and elegant, abeit hard dues to it being a souls-like.
