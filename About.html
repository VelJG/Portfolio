                <p>Hello there. My name is Khuong Huynh. I also goes by "VelJG" as my online nickname</p>
                <p>I'm currently a college student and studying Software Engineering</p>
                <p>As you can see, my favorite hobby is gaming. I've been fascinated with games since I was a child, watching other family members play them on PC. Gaming has provided me with relaxation after school, entertained me, and offered various information and knowledge. It has also helped me build new relationships, meet new people, and strengthen bonds in existing relationships.</p>
